## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This application must allow the management of the tasks to be performed, including their creation, modification, deletion and categorization.


### Prerequisites

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - API testing
- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11) - Java programming language
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) - Software project management
- [Intellij IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) - IDE for software developers
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - MySQL database

You must have previously installed the mysql server and created the schema tasks to be able to run the backend.

### Installing

Download and install all tools and frameworks on your local desktop and select a directory to clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/johnnycastro72/final-project-be
cd final-project-be
Intellij IDEA download and install all dependencies
```

### And coding style tests

This project was developed using java as programming language based on OOP paradigm, [spring boot initilz](https://start.spring.io/), and MySQL database.
